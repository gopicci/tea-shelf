# Tea Shelf UI


Tea Shelf is a **progressive web app** built with the intent to help users keep
track of their collection of teas. This documentation offers an overview on the
app frontend, written in **Typescript** with **React web framework**.

## Structure
Being a PWA, Tea Shelf makes extensive use of browser caching to assure offline
capabilities. 

The UI is a one page app build with a mobile first approach and a lot of main
components translate well between platforms. There are however a few more
specific components to assure a proper user experience.
